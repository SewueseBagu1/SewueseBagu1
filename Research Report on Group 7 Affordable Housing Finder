2. Cryptocurrency & Blockchain-Based Transactions
 Opportunity: NPC can differentiate itself by integrating crypto payment options and blockchain-based property verification, reducing fraud risks and improving transaction security.
3. Expansion into Emerging Cities
Opportunity: While Lagos and Abuja dominate listings, Ibadan, Port Harcourt, Enugu, and Kaduna are experiencing growth in property demand due to better infrastructure and lower living costs.
